<p>While continuing my journey in F#, after playing with Project Eulero problems for a few weeks, 
  I have come across another excellentÂ  excercise site which goes under the name of 
  <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/" target="_blank">Programming Praxis</a>.</p>
<p>The first exercise requires to implement a simple calculator using 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" target="_blank">Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)</a>.</p>
<p>Here follows a simple solution to the problem. Operands are pushed 
  onto the stack until an operator is found: at that point the last two operands are popped from the stack, 
  the operator is applied to them and the result is pushed back on the stack.</p>

{% highlight F# %}

let is_operator c =
    match c with
        | "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"  -> true
        | _ -> false

let calculate left operator right =
    match operator with
        | "+" -> left + right
        | "-" -> left - right
        | "*" -> left * right
        | "/" -> left / right
        | _ -> failwith "Unknown operator"

let proc (item:string) (stack:System.Collections.Generic.Stack<double>) =
    if is_operator item then
        let r = stack.Pop() 
        let l = stack.Pop() 
        let result = calculate l item r
        stack.Push result
    else
        stack.Push(System.Convert.ToDouble(item))

let evaluate (expression:string) =
    let stack = new System.Collections.Generic.Stack<double>()
    let items = expression.Split([|' ' |]) 
    Array.iter (fun i -> proc i stack) items
    stack.Pop()
{% endhighlight %}

<ul>
<li>We first define a simple function to check whether a given string is to be interpreted as an arithmetic operand. 
  As you can see, we only support basic operators, nothing too fancy.</li>
<li>We then define a function which takes a double, a string (representing an operator) and another double, 
  and returns the result of applying the given operator to the two numbers.</li>
<li>The <code>proc</code> function takes a string, which represent either an operand or an operator, and a stack of operands.
<p>If the item contained in the string is an operator, two operands are popped from the stack: the first pop 
  is for the right side operand and the second pop is for the left operand; hence, the operator is applied 
  to the two operands and the result is pushed back onto the stack.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if it's an operand, it's first converted from the string format and pushed onto the stack.</li>
<li>Finally, the entrance point to the program is defined with the <code>evaluate</code> function, which
<ul>
<li>accepts a string containing the overall expression (such as "1 2 + 4 / 5 * 6 -")</li>
<li>splits the string into an array of token strings</li>
<li>feed each token into the <code>proc</code> function</li>
<li>finally pops the stack with the last operand to yield the result of the operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
