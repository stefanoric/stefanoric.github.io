<p>It's time for another Project Euler exercise. This time around it is problem 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2<sup>15</sup> = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.</p>
<p>What is the sum of the digits of the number 2<sup>1000</sup>?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>I have tried to find an elegant way to solve this problem at a mathematical level, but I couldn't gain any 
  insight relating powers of 2 to their representation in base 10 (I'd love to know if such a thing exists). 
  Therefore I resorted to solve this problem with brute force.</p>

<p>Luckily F# (and now all other .NET 4.0 cousin languages) sports the <code>BigInteger</code> numeric type which helps 
tackling such huge numbers.</p>

<p>There are basically two approaches to solve this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transform the result of exponentiation into a <em>string</em> and iterate through the string adding up all the individual digits, or</li>
<li>Do without strings, and decompose the big number into the individual digits on my own.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have decided to take the second route because it seemed like a more interesting exercise (the first approach could probably lead to a one-liner). </p>

<p>Let's consider a generic number \(n\) and consider how we can describe it as a sum of powers of 10:</p>
$$ n = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i10^i $$

<p>For example</p>

$$ 423 = 3 \cdot 10^0 + 2\cdot 10^1 + 4 \cdot 10^2 $$

<p>and \( k = 2, d_0 = 3, d_1 = 2, d_2 = 4 \)

<p>So, given a generic number \(n\), we need to find the highest power of ten (\(k\)) such that 
  \(\frac{n}{10^k} > 0\)
</p>
<p>(logarithms will help us there). After \(k\) is found, we can start diving \(n\) by \(10^k\) to find \(d_k\) and use 
the reminder of the division to calculate \(d_{k-1}\) and so forth until we reach \(d_0\).</p>
