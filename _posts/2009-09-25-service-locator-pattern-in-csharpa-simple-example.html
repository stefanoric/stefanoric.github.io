<p>A Service Locator is a common design pattern that allows decoupling clients of 
	services (described by a public interface) from the concrete class implementing those services. 
	Martin Fowler has a great introduction on the topic in his 
	<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion of Control 
	Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern</a>.</p>
<p>What follows is a very simple service locator implementation in C# based on generics.</p>
<p>Let's start defining the contract of a service locator.</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public interface IServiceLocator
{
    T GetService<T>();
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's see a very simple implementation of this contract:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
class ServiceLocator : IServiceLocator
{
	// map that contains pairs of interfaces and
	// references to concrete implementations
	private IDictionary<object, object> services;

	internal ServiceLocator()
	{
		services = new Dictionary<object, object>();

		// fill the map
		this.services.Add(typeof(IServiceA), new ServiceA());
		this.services.Add(typeof(IServiceB), new ServiceB());
		this.services.Add(typeof(IServiceC), new ServiceC());
	}

	public T GetService<T>()
	{
		try
		{
			return (T)services[typeof(T)];
		}
		catch (KeyNotFoundException)
		{
			throw new ApplicationException("The requested service is not registered");
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see,</p>
<ul>
<li>the constructor of the class registers all the available services in a dictionary. 
	In our example, we have 3 different services accessible through <code>IServiceA</code>, 
	<code>IServiceB</code>, and <code>IServiceC</code>. It is assumed here that <code>ServiceA</code> 
	implements <code>IServiceA</code> and so forth.</li>
<li>the generic GetService() method returns a reference the correct implementation 
	fetching it from the dictionary</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how a client would invoke the service:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
IServiceLocator locator = new ServiceLocator();
IServiceA myServiceA = locator.GetService<IServiceA>();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The clients do not know the actual classes implementing the service. 
	They only have to interact with the service locator to get to an implementation.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>This is as simple as it gets. There are several improvements that a real-world implementation 
	of a service locator should consider (what follows is only a partial list):</p>
<ul>
<li>The service locator itself might be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton</a>. 
There usually is no need to have two instances of a service locator.</li>
<li><a href="/2009/10/13/service-locator-pattern-in-c-with-lazy-initialization/">Lazy initialization</a> 
of services might be considered. In the example above, the constructor creates new instances 
for all possible services; initialization might be deferred until some client actually requests 
a particular service.</li>
<li>The mapping between interfaces and implementation might be more flexible 
	using metadata (e.g. through application configuration files)</li>
</ul>
