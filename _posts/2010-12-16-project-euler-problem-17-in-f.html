<p>Project Euler problem 17 turned out to be quite an easy one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.</p>
<p>If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
<p><small>NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The solution this time is almost trivial:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<em>Zero</em>" is considered to have 0 length (it will be obvious later on why this is the case)</li>
<li>Numbers from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>19</strong> have their own unique names (i.e. they are not composed by putting together more words)</li>
<li>Numbers from <strong>20</strong> to<strong> 99</strong> are combined putting together a word like "<em>thirty</em>" and a number from 0 to 9. If the number is zero, we don't add anything (we don't say <em>"twenty and zero"</em>)</li>
<li>Numbers from <strong>100 </strong>to <strong>999 </strong>are combined putting together a words like "<em>two hundred and</em>" plus a number from 0 to 99 composed as explained above. Exact multiples of <strong>100 </strong>are exception in that they don't have another trailing number (again, we don't say "<em>two hundred and zero</em>").</li>
</ul>
