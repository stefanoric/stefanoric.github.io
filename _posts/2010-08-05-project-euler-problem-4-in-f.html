<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=4">Project Euler problem number 4</a> asks 
the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of 
two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.</p>
<p>Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here follows my solution:</p>

{% highlight F# %}
open System

let rec is_palindromic (a:string) =
    let length = a.Length;
    match a with
        | &quot;&quot;  -> true
        | x -> match length with
                 | 1 -> true
                 | _ -> x.[0] = x.[length-1] && 
                       is_palindromic (x.Substring(1,(length - 2)))
                 
let max_palindrome =
    let numbers = seq {
        for i in 100 .. 999 do
            for j in 100 .. 999 do
                if is_palindromic(Convert.ToString(i*j)) then yield (i*j) }
    Seq.max numbers
{% endhighlight %}

<p>A few considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I first define a general recursive function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome.
<p>I basically check the first and last characters of the string; if they are the same I continue with 
  the second and second last, and so on until I either found a pair of chars that do not match or there's 
  only one char or none left.</p>
<p> Alternatively, I could have reversed the string and compared the original and reversed 
  strings for equality; however that would have been not just more work than 
  actually needed by the algorithm, but less useful as an excercise in learning F#.</p>
</li>
<li> The actual algorithm uses brute force to test for palindromicity (neologism?) all 
  the numbers that can be composed multiplying together 3 digits numbers (those from 100 to 999), 
  picking the highest one. Again, as in a previous <a href="/2010/07/01/project-euler-problem-3-in-f/">problem</a>, 
  I am using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension#F.23">comprehension</a> 
  to generate a list of candidates.
</li>
</ul>
