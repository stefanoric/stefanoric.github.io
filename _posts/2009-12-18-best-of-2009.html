<p>It's been a little more than 6 months that I have started blogging and it's already time to 
  look back and have a small retrospective. All in all, it's been a lot of fun putting together post after post.</p>
<p>I haven't got a strict publishing schedule, and I tend to prefer quality over quantity.<br />
That being said, not all posts are created equal and inevitably some received greater attention than others. 
Here's a little list of the posts that have ranked higher in my stats.</p>
<h3>Visual Studio 2008</h3>
<p>Overall, posts related to Visual Studio tend to gather a lot of audience. 
  The post on the shortcuts is ranking number 1 in my statistics. A sign that many developers still prefer to move around using the mouse as little as possible. And so do I.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Design By Contract</h3>
<p>During the summer I have started investigating Microsoft's way to Design By Contract, that is <strong>Microsoft Contracts</strong>. These introductory articles have received their fair share of visitors.</p>

</ul>
<h3>WCF</h3>
<p>Moving files around with WCF seems to be a pretty common task, yet there have been very little posts on this topic on the net. Therefore once I managed to put together a workable solution, I shared my implementation so that others may pick it from there and adjust to taste. As expected, these two posts have become a hit.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Service Locator</h3>
<p>In one of my projects I have found myself in the need of creating a tiny service locator. I didn't want to bring in our company's full fledged IoC container in this case, to keep depenencies to a minimum. This series of post describing that little implementation have been fairly succesful.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>I am currently reading many technical books at the same time. 
  One of the best of the group has been the <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>. Despite being a recent post, this one is already ranking very high, possibly because of the recent surge of interest around the <strong>sofware craftsmanship</strong> movement.</p>
