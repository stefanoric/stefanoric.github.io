<p>In a <a href="/2009/06/26/introduction-to-microsoft-code-contracts-with-visual-studio-2008/">previous post</a> 
we introduced Microsoft Code Contracts, and got an idea of what Design by Contract (DBC) is all about. 
It's now time to introduce another  powerful concept that complements and 
completes <em>preconditions </em>and <em>postconditions </em>when you specify the behavior of your object: class <em>invariants</em>.</p>
<p><em>Invariants </em>define all those conditions (or <em>predicates</em>, if you will) 
that are guaranteed to be true for all objects of a particular class throughout its life-cycle: 
these invariants need first to be met during construction and continue to hold 
before and after methods invocations.</p>
<p>Let's consider a very simple implementation of a class that represents a calendar date, 
  specified by day, month and year:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class Date
{
  public short Day { get; }
  public short Month { get; }
  public short Year { get; }

  public Date(short dd, short mm, short yy)
  {
    Day = dd;
    Month = mm;
    Year = yy;
  }

  public void Increment()
  {
    // some tricky code to increment the day,
    // month (if needed) and year (if needed)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Oversimplifying, such an object has some obvious invariants, or conditions that must always be met:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Day</code>, <code>Month</code>, and <code>Year</code> may not be negative</li>
<li><code>Day</code> must be a number between 1 and 31 (let's simplify and assume all months have the same days)</li>
<li><code>Month</code> must be a number between 1 and 12</li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions must be true upon successful creation of a <code>Date</code> 
object <em>and</em> after each invocation of <code>Increment()</code>.</p>
<p>With Code Contracts, one expresses invariants using a special method tagged 
  with a <code>[ContractInvariantMethod]</code> attribute; it is usually named <code>ObjectInvariant</code> 
  although this is just a convention: you can name it anything you like.</p>
  
{% highlight C# %}
public class Date
{
  // ...
  // rest of the class as listing above

  [ContractInvariantMethod]
  protected void ObjectInvariant()
  {
    Contract.Invariant(this.Day >= 0);
    Contract.Invariant(this.Day <= 31);
    Contract.Invariant(this.Month >= 0);
    Contract.Invariant(this.Month <= 12);
    Contract.Invariant(this.Year >= 0);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You are not allowed to put any other code but the invariants; the method must have 
  a <code>void</code> return type and be protected (unless the class is sealed of course).</p>
<p>Invariants are checked at the end of every public method (including constructors and 
  excluding finalizers and methods implementing <code>IDisposable.Dispose()</code>) - in 
  our example, every time a client of this class invokes the <code>Increment()</code> method, 
  the invariants will be checked.</p>
<p>Invariants, along with pre and postconditions, are inherited by subclasses. We'll see 
  how this fits in a sound object oriented design in the next post.</p>
