<p><em>This is the first post on a small series about transferring large files with WCF using streaming</em> :</p>

</ul>
<p>WCF streaming is helpful in all those cases when you need to move a lot of data between 
  the client and the service in a way that keeps memory consumption under control 
  (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733742.aspx">Large Data and Streaming</a> on MSDN for 
  more details if you are not familiar with the topic).</p>
  
<p>Streaming does impose some restrictions. Among them is that your operations can only 
  have one input and/or output parameter and they can only be only one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Stream</li>
<li>a Message</li>
<li>a class implementing IXmlSerializable</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to expose a very simple service to upload and download files through WCF. 
  And because I wanted to be able to pass both the file content as a stream <em>and</em> 
  at least the file name, I could not just use a Stream but had to resort to 
  using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734675.aspx">Messages</a>: 
  the headers would convey the file information (such as the file type) and the body the content
  of the file itself through a stream.</p>
  
<p>I therefore defined the service as follows:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://schemas.acme.it/2009/04")]
public interface IFileTransferService
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void UploadFile(FileUploadMessage request);
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = false)]
    FileDownloadReturnMessage DownloadFile(FileDownloadMessage request);
}

[MessageContract]
public class FileUploadMessage
{
    [MessageHeader(MustUnderstand = true)]
    public FileMetaData Metadata;
    [MessageBodyMember(Order = 1)]
    public Stream FileByteStream;
}

[MessageContract]
public class FileDownloadMessage
{
    [MessageHeader(MustUnderstand = true)]
    public FileMetaData FileMetaData;
}

[MessageContract]
public class FileDownloadReturnMessage
{
    public FileDownloadReturnMessage(FileMetaData metaData, Stream stream)
    {
        this.DownloadedFileMetadata = metaData;
        this.FileByteStream = stream;
    }

    [MessageHeader(MustUnderstand = true)]
    public FileMetaData DownloadedFileMetadata;
    [MessageBodyMember(Order = 1)]
    public Stream FileByteStream;
}

[DataContract(Namespace = "http://schemas.acme.it/2009/04")]
public class FileMetaData
{
    public FileMetaData(
        string localFileName,
        string remoteFileName)
    {
        this.LocalFileName = localFileName;
        this.RemoteFileName = remoteFileName;
        this.FileType = FileTypeEnum.Generic;
    }

    public FileMetaData(
        string localFileName,
        string remoteFileName,
        FileTypeEnum fileType)
    {
        this.LocalFileName = localFileName;
        this.RemoteFileName = remoteFileName;
        this.FileType = fileType;
    }

    [DataMember(Name="FileType", Order=0, IsRequired=true)]
    public FileTypeEnum FileType;</p>
    [DataMember(Name="localFilename", Order=1, IsRequired=false)]
    public string LocalFileName;
    [DataMember(Name = "remoteFilename", Order = 2, IsRequired = false)]
    public string RemoteFileName;
}

public class FileTransferService : IFileTransferService
{
    public void UploadFile(FileUploadMessage request)
    {
          // implementation here
    }

    public FileDownloadReturnMessage DownloadFile(FileDownloadMessage request)
    {
          // implementation here
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I am omitting the details of the implementation, they are pretty straightforward 
  (if you are interested, I will gladly share it. <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">
    UPDATE</span>: I have put the basic scheleton of the server implementation is a 
    separate <a href="/2009/10/02/file-transfer-with-wcf-part-ii/">post</a></em>).</p>
    
<p>And this is how the service was configured on the server side within the web.config.</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<system.serviceModel>
    <behaviors>
      <serviceBehaviors>
        <behavior name="serviceBehavior">
          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="true"/>
          <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true"
                              httpHelpPageEnabled="true" />
          <dataContractSerializer maxItemsInObjectGraph="2147483647"/>
      </serviceBehaviors>
    </behaviors>
    <services>
      <service behaviorConfiguration="serviceBehavior"
                  name="FileTransferService">
        <endpoint address=""
                  name="basicHttpStream"
                  binding="basicHttpBinding"
                  bindingConfiguration="httpLargeMessageStream"
                  contract="IFileTransferService" />
        <endpoint address="mex"
                      binding="mexHttpBinding"
                      contract="IMetadataExchange"/>
      </service>
    </services>
    <bindings>
      <basicHttpBinding>
        <binding name="httpLargeMessageStream"
                    maxReceivedMessageSize="2147483647"
                    transferMode="Streamed"
                    messageEncoding="Mtom" />
      </basicHttpBinding>
    </bindings>
  </system.serviceModel>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is the base of the plumbing that it's needed to create the service.</p>
<p>While I was developing it, I have lost quite some time for an error which was really obscure to decipher:<br />
<em>Server Error in '/' Application. Operation 'UploadFile' in contract 'IFileTransferService' uses a 
  MessageContract that has SOAP headers. SOAP headers are not supported by the None MessageVersion.</em></p>
<p>Googling and binging around I found almost no relevant information on the topic, so I was pretty on my own.</p>
<p>I thought the problem was in the HTTP binding that I was using (maybe it was not compatible with SOAP headers?). 
  Unfortunately the HTTP binding did not have any way to specify a different <em>MessageVersion</em>. 
  So I ended up creating a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa347793.aspx">custom binding</a>, 
  like the following, but that didn't help either:</p>
  
{% highlight xml %}
      <customBinding>
        <binding name="customHttpBindingStream">
          <textMessageEncoding messageVersion="Default"/>
          <httpTransport
               transferMode="Streamed"
               maxReceivedMessageSize="2147483647" />
        </binding>
      </customBinding>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I made several other attempts with no luck. I then tried self hosting the service 
  and that did work. Then I was certain that it was something with the web hosting. 
  Tried IIS6, IIS7, etc... Same exception all the time.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, at the end, while reducing my web.config to the bare bones, 
  I found the culprit: it was the name of the service in the service configuration.</p>
<p>Instead of writing:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
      <service behaviorConfiguration="serviceBehavior"
                  name="FileTransferService">
{% endhighlight %}

</p>
<p>I had written by mistake:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
      <service behaviorConfiguration="serviceBehavior"
                  name="FileTransfer">
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Talk about meaningful error messages!</p>
