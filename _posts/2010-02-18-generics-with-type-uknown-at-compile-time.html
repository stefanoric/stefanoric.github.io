<p>The following is an example of a service containing both generic method calls and generic types.</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public interface IContainer<T>
{
    IEnumerable<IProperty<T>> Properties { get; }
}

public interface IPropertyService
{
    IContainer<T> GetProperties<T>(string propertyCode);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now suppose that you don't know the actual type of the data until runtime (possibly because the type 
    is retrieved from a DB or from some other service). You need a way to interact with these generics, 
    and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.aspx">Reflection </a>can 
    help you here.</p>
<p>Let's assume that you have managed to get the <code>Type</code> of the data that you 
are handling (such as <code>string</code>, <code>decimal</code>, <code>double</code>, etc...) 
and that you have a concrete implementation of the <code>IPropertyService</code> (perhaps through Dependency Injection).</p>
<p>Once you have that, you can invoke the <code>GetProperty</code> method in the following way:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
Type type = // ... this is the actual runtime type
IPropertyService service = // ... this is an instance of the service

Type serviceType = typeof(IPropertyService);
MethodInfo getPropertiesInfo =
    serviceType.GetMethod("GetProperties", new Type[] { typeof(string) });

if (getPropertiesInfo == null)
{
    // Uh-oh.... has the interface changed after we wrote this? Throw an exception...
}

Type[] genericArguments = { type }; // we only have one generic argument (<t>)
MethodInfo getPropertiesMethodInfo =
    getPropertiesInfo.MakeGenericMethod(genericArguments);

// Finally invoke the method to search for a price
var propertiesContainer =
    getPropertiesMethodInfo.Invoke(service, new object[] { "price"});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see are quite a few steps to be performed, but at the end, through reflection, 
    you end up with a container filled with all the objects that you have required.</p>
<p>Now assume that you want to access to the single properties contained in the IContainer. 
    You need some way to invoke the C# property <code>Properties</code>. defined on <code>IContainer</code>. 
    Similarly to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.methodinfo.aspx">MethodInfo</a> 
    class, System.Reflection has a 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.propertyinfo.aspx">PropertyInfo </a>class 
    that you can use to work with Properties.</p>
<p>The following solution, despite compiling fine, will not work at run-time:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
PropertyInfo containerInfo = typeof(IContainer<>).GetProperty("Properties"); // WRONG!!!
if (containerInfo == null)
{
    // the interface has changed. Throw an exception
}

var properties = containerInfo.GetValue(container, null) as IEnumerable;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you try to run this, you will be greeted by the following exception: <em>Late 
    bound operations cannot be performed on types or methods for which ContainsGenericParameters is true.</em></p>
<p>After scratching my head for a while, I realized that I should have 
    first created a generic type at run-time before retrieving the <code>PropertyInfo</code>:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
Type containerType = typeof(IContainer<>).MakeGenericType(type);
PropertyInfo containerInfo = containerType.GetProperty("Properties");
if (containerInfo == null)
{
    // the interface has changed. Throw an exception
}

var properties = containerInfo.GetValue(container, null) as IEnumerable;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>At this point I have a collection of <code>IProperties</code> which I can enumerate through. 
If needed, since the types in this collection are also generic, I need to repeat the process above 
until I reach a fundamental type (such as <code>string</code>, <code>double</code>, etc...).</p>
