<p>In my current project I have found myself needing to parse a CSV file coming from a legacy C++ application. 
    This is a fairly common task, and in the past I have always written the parsing engine myself, 
    especially when there was some validation related to the business logic involved.</p>
<p>This time I have chosen to try the reportedly excellent <a href="http://www.filehelpers.com/">FileHelpers</a> library.
Why reinvent the wheel yet another time? The library is well documented and in a matter of
 minutes I was able to start experimenting with some test data.</p>
<p>To simplify the discussion, suppose that the CSV file has the following structure:</p>

<pre>
# City, Date, Temperature
Chicago; 20090913 07:00:00; 62.23
New York; 20090913 08:00:00; 81.3
</pre>

<p>Each row of the CSV file is mapped to the following class:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[DelimitedRecord(";")]
[IgnoreEmptyLines()]
[ConditionalRecord(RecordCondition.ExcludeIfBegins, "#")]
public class CsvRecord
{
    public string City;

    [FieldConverter(ConverterKind.Date, "yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss")]
    public DateTime Date;

    [FieldConverter(ConverterKind.Double, ".")]
    public double Temperature;
}
{% endhighlight%}

<p>The attributes are pretty self-explanatory: they specify which is the separator 
    value and which lines can be ignored.</p>
<p>The interesting part here is the way FileHelpers allows to specify a pattern to 
    convert a string into a <code>DateTime</code> value. In this case, the pattern used
     here is <code>yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss</code> to match the CSV file.</p>
<p>Once the mapping between the CSV and the .NET object is setup, I have
     created a class wrapping the FileHelpers engine (just in case some day I want to 
     change the parsing engine), with the following (simplified) method:</p>
     
{% highlight C# %}
public IEnumerable<CsvRecord> GetRecordsFromFile(Stream s)
{
   FileHelperEngine engine = new FileHelperEngine(typeof(CsvRecord));
   s.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

   CsvRecord[] records = engine.ReadStream(new StreamReader(s)) as CsvRecord[];
   return records;
}
{% endhighlight%}

<p>This was working like a charm... until I moved the code to a separate test machine. 
    All of a sudden the parser would complain that it could not parse 
    the dates from the file. After a lot of thought, I realized that the test 
    machine had a different regional settings: while my machine had English formats, 
    the test machine had Italian formats. And for some reason FileHelpers was not able 
    to work correctly in this scenario (even though I had explicitly specified the date 
    and time pattern in the <code>CsvRecord</code> class).</p>
<p>Luckily, FileHelpers lets you specify your own converters if the predefined ones won't do.
    I therefore created my custom converter for the dates as follows:</p>
    
{% highlight C# %}
public class CustomDateTimeConverter : ConverterBase
{
    private const string DateTimeFormat = "yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss";

    public override object StringToField(string from)
    {
        return DateTime.ParseExact(from, DateTimeFormat, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    }
}
{% endhighlight%}

<p>and rewritten the <code>CsvRecord</code> class as follows:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[DelimitedRecord(";")]
[IgnoreEmptyLines()]
[ConditionalRecord(RecordCondition.ExcludeIfBegins, "#")]
public class CsvRecord
{
    public string City;

    [FieldConverter(typeof(CustomDateTimeConverter))]
    public DateTime Date;

    [FieldConverter(ConverterKind.Double, ".")]
    public double Temperature;
}
{% endhighlight%}

<p>This time it worked also with Italian locale.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't know why the FileHelpers class had problems with the 
    Italian locale (possibly with locales different from English ones). 
    Probably having a look at the source code would reveal the truth.</p>
<p>I suspect that it is parsing the dates with a given format but without 
    specifying an invariant culture format provider. But that is just a wild guess.</p>
