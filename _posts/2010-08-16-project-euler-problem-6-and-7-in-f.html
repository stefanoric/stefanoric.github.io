<p>Project Euler problem 6 is one of the easiest that I have encountered so far. 
  Also, Problem 7 is quite easy to solve once you have a function for prime numbers 
  (something we did in <a href="/2010/07/01/project-euler-problem-3-in-f/">Problem 3</a>). 
  Therefore, in this post I give 2 problems for the price of 1! :)</p>
<h2>Problem 6</h2>
<p>Let's have a look at the question for Problem 6:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
<p>1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385<br />
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
<p>(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025</p>
<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.</p>
<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a few known tricks to calculate the sum of the squares;
however, given the limited size of the problem at hand, brute-force is perfectly fine: 
it shows once more the elegance of a declarative solution.</p>

{% highlight F# %}
open System

let square x = x * x

// a^2 + b^2  + ... + z^2 
let sum_of_square max =
    Seq.unfold (fun x -> if x > max then None else Some(x*x, x+1)) 1
    |> Seq.sum

// (a +b + ... + z)^2 
let square_of_sum max =
    {1 .. max}
    |> Seq.sum
    |> square

let problem_6 max =
    square_of_sum(max) - sum_of_square(max)
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Problem 7</h2>
<blockquote><p>
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.</p>
<p>What is the 10001st prime number?
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, this one is fairly easy once you know how to tell 
  whether a given number is prime or not. We did that exercise in 
  <a href="/2010/07/01/project-euler-problem-3-in-f/">Problem 3</a>.</p>
<p>There's a catch though: this time we are <i>counting</i> the prime numbers. 
In the test we did in <a href="/2010/07/01/project-euler-problem-3-in-f/">Problem 3</a> 
there was a small error that in that context was irrelevant: the test returned <code>true</code> 
also for 0 and 1, which strictly speaking are not prime numbers (2 is considered to be the first prime number).</p>
<p>For this reason, I have modified the code of <code>is_prime</code> 
a bit so that the first prime will be 2, the second 3, and so on as appropriate.</p>

{% highlight F# %}
open System

let is_prime x =
    let rec check i =
        x > 1L && 
       (double i > sqrt (double x) || (x % i <> 0L && check (i + 1L)))
    check 2L                 

let sequence_of_first_n_primes n =
    Seq.initInfinite (fun x -> int64 x)
    |> Seq.filter is_prime
    |> Seq.take n
    |> Seq.max
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Ok... break time is over. <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=8">Problem 8</a> looks a bit more challenging. 
See you when I have got a nice solution for that.</p>
