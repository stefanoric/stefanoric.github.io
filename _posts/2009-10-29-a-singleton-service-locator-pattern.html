<p>This is the third post of a series on the Service Locator pattern. In the <a href="/2009/09/25/service-locator-pattern-in-csharpa-simple-example/">first post</a> I described how to create a basic service locator for your C# application, while in the <a href="/2009/10/13/service-locator-pattern-in-c-with-lazy-initialization/">second post</a> I introduced lazy initialization of the services.</p>
<p>We now add another piece to our puzzle, transforming the Service Locator class into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton</a>.</p>
<h1>The Singleton Pattern</h1>
<p>The singleton is arguably the most known and controversial design pattern. Some say <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingletonsAreGood">singletons are good</a>, some says <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingletonsAreEvil">singletons are evil</a>. Eric Gamma himself (one of the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour">Gang Of Four</a>) in a recent <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1404056">interview</a> stated that (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>When discussing which patterns to drop, we found that we still love them all. (Not reallyâ€”<strong>I'm in favor of dropping Singleton. Its use is almost always a design smell.</strong>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't have a strong opinion either way; I tend to use it sparingly and in the following code I will show how to apply this pattern to the service locator. There are already countless blogs discussing the pros and the cons of the singleton pattern, therefore I won't discuss about it any further.</p>
<h1>The Singleton Service Locator</h1>
<p>The following was our initial implementation (other details of the classes have been removed for clarity). The constructor was <em>internal</em>, allowing all potential clients from within the assembly to invoke it. Clients could either pass around a reference to the created service locator, or instantiate new instances each time:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
internal class ServiceLocator : IServiceLocator
{
    // a map between contracts -> concrete implementation classes
    private IDictionary<Type, Type> servicesType;

    // a map containing references to concrete implementation already instantiated
    // (the service locator uses lazy instantiation).
    private IDictionary<Type, object> instantiatedServices;

    internal ServiceLocator()
    {
        this.servicesType = new Dictionary<Type, Type>();
        this.instantiatedServices = new Dictionary<Type, object>();

        this.BuildServiceTypesMap();
    }

    // rest of the methods
 }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To implement the singleton pattern, we make the constructor <em>private</em> and provide clients with a static method through which we can retrieve an instance of the service.</p>
<p>Note how the creation of the single instance of the ServiceLocator class is itself lazy and thread safe. There are a few variations on the theme when it comes to singleton thread safe initialization (see for example <a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/singleton.html">this post</a> by Jon Skeet).</p>

{% highlight C# %}
internal class ServiceLocator : IServiceLocator
{
        // a map between contracts -> concrete implementation classes
        private IDictionary<Type, Type> servicesType;
        private static readonly object TheLock = new Object();

        private static IServiceLocator instance;

        // a map containing references to concrete implementation already instantiated
        // (the service locator uses lazy instantiation).
        private readonly IDictionary<Type, object> instantiatedServices;

        private ServiceLocator()
        {
            this.servicesType = new Dictionary<Type, Type>();
            this.instantiatedServices = new Dictionary<Type, object>();

            this.BuildServiceTypesMap();
        }

        public static IServiceLocator Instance
        {
            get
            {
                lock (TheLock) // thread safety
                {
                    if (instance == null)
                    {
                        instance = new ServiceLocator();
                    }
                }

                return instance;
            }
        }

        // rest of the methods
 }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Clients will now simply invoke the <code>GetService()</code> method through the singleton instance, without having to create a new object each time:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
IServiceA service = 
    ServiceLocator.Instance.GetService<IUniverseFileServiceAdapter>();
{% endhighlight %}
