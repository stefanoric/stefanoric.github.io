<p>Yet another episode in <a href="http://stefanoricciardi.com/tag/euler-problems/">my attempts to solve Project Euler problems</a>.</p>
<p>Enter problem number 5:</p>
<blockquote><p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.</p>
<p>What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll first show you my solution and then explain the bits:</p>

{% highlight F# %}
// greatest common divisor (Euclid Algorithm)
let rec gcd (a:int64, b:int64) =
    match b with
       | x when x = 0L -> a
       | _ -> gcd (b, a % b)

// least common divisor
let rec lcm (a:int64, b:int64) =
    (a * b) / gcd (a,b)

// least common divisor for a list of numbers
let rec lcmlist (list: int64 list) =
    match list with
        | [] -> 1L
        | [a] ->  a
        | [a;b] ->  lcm(a,b)
        | h::t  ->  lcm(h, lcmlist t)

// utility to generate a list of all integers
// up to a certain number
let generateListTo top =
    let l = [for i in 1L .. int64 top ->  i]
    l

let resolveProblem5 =
    generateListTo 20 |>  lcmlist
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The first thing to realize when reading this problem is that what is really being asked is<br />
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple">least common multiple</a> (<em>lcm</em> from now on) 
of a list of numbers (in particular, the numbers from 1 to 20 included).</p>
<p>There's a straightforward way to compute the \(lcm\)</em>, by using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">greatest common divisor</a> (<em>gcd</em>), as follows:</p>
$$
lcm(a,b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{gcd(a,b)}
$$
<p>As for the <em>gcd</em> itself, it can be easily implemented using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclid Algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle comes when you realize how calculating the <em>lcd</em> of 
a set of numbers can be reduced to calculating <em>lcd</em>s pair-wise in the following fashion:</p>
$$
lcm(a,b,c,d) = lcm(a, lcm(b,c,d) = lcm(a, lcm(b, lcm(c,d)))
$$

<p>For example, given the numbers 3, 4, 14, and 18, their <em>lcm </em>would be computed in the following way:</p>

$$\begin{align*}
lcm (3,4,14, 18) &= lcm(3, lcm(4,14,18)) \\
                 &= lcm(3, lcm(4, lcm(14, 18))) \\
                 &= lcm(3, lcm(4, 126)) \\
                 &= lcm(3, 252) \\
                 &= 252
\end{align*}$$

<p>As you can see, the algorithm lends itself beautifully to recursion and such is the solution that I have provided. </p>
