## The Power of Composition
Speaker: [Scott Wlaschin](http://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin)  
Slides: [The Power of Composition](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/composition/)

Scott is a great speaker, with the right dose of British humor so I was happy
to find him at NDC with a new talk.

This was a beginner-level introduction to composition in functional programming
by Scott Wlaschin, using F# to illustrate the examples.

Using Lego and wooden railways as metaphors, he illustrates how to compose
functions to create services, how to combine services to create use cases and
how to combine use cases you can create an application using
[Suave.io](https://suave.io), a "lightweight, non blocking web server".

He goes on to de-mystify the "M word" showing how you can use functional
composition to solve the Fizz Buzz problem.


## API Gateway to Service Mesh: Navigating a Changing Landscape
Speaker: [Zhamak Dehghani](https://twitter.com/zhamakd)

The talk introduced some ideas about what a service mesh is and why you might
want one for cloud native applications.

In order to satisfy the needs of a cloud native set of applications (dynamic
discovery, load balancing, resiliency, traffic management, observability,
identity) you often end up having to develop client libraries for all the
technology stacks you want to support (NodeJs, Java, .NET, etc...). 

As an alternative you can have a service proxy (sidecar) so that traffic goes
through it. (such as [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). There is still a
problem with this approach that configuration needs to be replicated across all
services.

A step forward is to have a service mesh like [Istio](https://istio.io) to
provide visibility, resiliency, security and control for you micro-services
deployed in your container orchestrator.

## Diagnosing Issues in ASP.NET Core applications
Speakers: [David Fowler](https://twitter.com/davidfowl) and [Damian
Edwards](https://ndc-london.com/speaker/damian-edwards)  
Slides and code samples: https://github.com/davidfowl/NdcLondon2018

This was an interesting hands-on session on how to troubleshoot asp.net core
bugs, with specific emphasis on what has changed with ASP.NET and might cause
problems when porting code over.

Slides and example code are available on github. They mentioned an interesting
tool ([Ben.BlockingDetector](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.BlockingDetector))
to detect blocking calls in ASP.NET core applications.

Takeaways:

* porting over code from ASP.NET to ASP.NET core might cause synchronization
  bugs (deadlocks or thread starvation) if you are not careful.

* async all the things

* asynchronicity is viral (you cannot do it in parts)

* audit 3rd party code


## The Performance Investigator Field Guide
Speaker: [Sasha Goldshtein](https://twitter.com/goldshtn)  
Slides: https://t.co/By96ByJifg

Interesting talk about how to structure your investigation on performances
issues, what step to follows and what to do after you've fixed the issue.

Key takeaways:

* don't make assumptions

* don't just look under the street-light (where you have visibility)

* averages are meaningless, percentiles are OK you know what you are doing


## Critical Decision Making
Speaker: [Clifford Agius](https://twitter.com/cliffordagius) (airline pilot and geek)

This interesting talk describes a decision making tool (TDODAR) airline pilots
use to make effective decisions under pressure (think during an incident).

Key takeaways:

* Most situations are rule-based: you should already know what you best response
  should be given a situation, instead of coming up with a clever idea when you
  are handling an emergency.
  
* Work as a team, solicit inputs from all members (even the less experienced),
  and decide together the best response.


## Testing in Production (the Good, the Bad and the Less Pretty)
Speaker: Gel Goldsby

TL;DR: Speaker's team integration tests took to long to run, slowing the release
cycle so they decided to skip the tests in the staging environments; they moved
the test execution after releasing to production and rolling back in case
something was wrong (anecdotally, this happens for them about once per month).

Requirements for this to work:

* releases only contain one commit, to simplify rollbacks

* tons of logging, monitoring and alerting. 

* full cycle developers (coder/tester/deployer/business analyst/on-call)

They usually allow the next release to happen after about 1 hour.


This was the talk that raised the most questions from the audience of all the
ones I attended to, like what happens when the release corrupts the data? The
gist of the answer was that this does not apply to all kind of software, so they
usually can get away with software rollbacks only but that does not mean that
anyone can.


## Harnessing Chaos: the hidden ingredient behind building better systems
Speaker: [Russ Miles](https://twitter.com/russmiles)

The author (after an amusing musical intro) starts describing the [Cynefim
framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) where problems are
categorized in four quadrants (Simple, Complicate, Complex and Chaotic) and
making the point that if you are building microservices you are probably living
in the chaotic quadrant.

The goal of chaos engineering is try to move away from chaos into the complex
quadrant and that a better definition not to scare the business would be
"limited scope, continuous disaster recovery".

Key takeaways:

* it's about learning, not harming your system.

* chaos should not be a surprise. It starts with a conversation, you cannot just
  "break things".

* if you already know the consequences, don't do the experiment. If you know
  that it will break, there is nothing to learn.
