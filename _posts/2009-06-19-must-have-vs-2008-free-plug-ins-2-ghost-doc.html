<p>According to the Wikipedia, a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a></em> is a</p>
<blockquote><p>professional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer">writer</a> who is paid to write books,
articles, stories, reports, or other texts that are officially credited to another person.</p></blockquote>
<p><span>As the name seems to imply, <a href="http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx">Ghost-Doc</a> 
plug-in for Visual Studio is something like that: instead of typing in the XML documentation for your 
source code yourself, Ghost-Doc does the heavy-lifting and fills it for you.</span></p>
<p>Suppose you have a very simple class like the following:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public sealed class TestGhostDoc
{
    double CalculateVAT(double priceOfGoods, double VATPercentage)
    {
        return (priceOfGoods + priceOfGoods * VATPercentage);
    }
}
{% endhighlight  %}

<p>Now you want to add XML documentation for the CalculateVAT member function. 
    All you have to do is to right-click somewhere on line 3 (I prefer to use 
    the <tt>CTRL + SHIFT + D</tt> since <a href="/2009/06/10/most-useful-visual-studio-2008-keyboard-shortcuts/">I 
    love shortcuts</a>), select “Document This”, and Ghost-Doc will fill 
    the XML documentation for you like the following:</p>
    
{% highlight C# %}
public sealed class TestGhostDoc
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates the VAT.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="priceOfGoods">The price of goods</param>
    /// <param name="VATPercentage">The VAT percentage</param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    double CalculateVAT(double priceOfGoods, double VATPercentage)
    {
        return priceOfGoods += priceOfGoods * VATPercentage;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see, Ghost-Doc, beside filling the structure for you, also fills the contents 
    using a set of rules based on the order of the words (the only thing that is left 
    is filling the content of the <tt>returns</tt> tag). Note that words are 
    recognized successfully only if you use the recommended Camel and Pascal casing 
    appropriately (which you ought to be doing anyway because you 
    <a href="/2009/06/12/must-have-vs-2008-free-plug-ins-1-style-cop/">follow 
    to the naming conventions</a>).</p>
<p>Member functions is not the only place where you can use Ghost-Doc: 
    class names, constructors, enums, properties, event, etc… they 
    are all supported as expected.</p>
    
{% highlight C# %}
namespace TestGhostDoc
{
    /// <summary>
    ///
    /// </summary>
    public sealed class User
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets the first name.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>The first name.</value>
        public string FirstName { get; set;  }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the address.
        /// </summary>
        /// <value>The address.</value>
        public string Address { get; }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Can you spot the difference between the documentations of the 
    two properties that Ghost-Doc has generated?</p>
<h3>Advanced use</h3>
<p>Ghost-Doc has a complete customization window where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>modify/add templates that Ghost-Doc uses to document a language element</li>
<li>define your own acronyms, that will always be rendered in all-caps by Ghost-Doc,
     even if you have written them in lower case inside a language element name to
      be compliant to the naming conventions</li>
<li>modify/add the list of words which define qualities, that Ghost-Doc will reorder 
    in a special way. For example, since <em>size</em> is on this special list 
    "FileBufferSize will be worded as “the size of the file buffer” instead of “the file buffer size” .</li>
<li>modify/add the list of words that shall never be preceded by “the” (the so called “no the” words).</li>
<li>Modify the way <em>true</em>, <em>false</em>, and <em>null </em>keywords are represented</li>
<li>Create a custom text that will be appended to all comments the first time they are created; this text can optionally be dynamic and include the name of the author, or the current date, etc.. (this would be a bit over the top IMHO since it would be repeated for each and every function, property, etc…).</li>
</ul>
