<p>I recently embarked on a journey to read (or re-read) all the great classic books in the software literature.</p>
<p>The <a title="The Pragmatic Programmer" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1256673093&amp;sr=8-1">Pragmatic Programmer</a> is one of those books which is usually included in the recommended readings for a software developer, and deservedly so. The book, released in 1999, has been so successful that the two authors, <a href="http://pragprog.com/about">Andrew Hunt</a> and <a href="http://pragprog.com/about">David Thomas</a>, have since created their own publishing company, the <a href="http://pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> (with titles spanning a broad range of programming topics).</p>
<p>This book must really  have been a breakthrough when it hit the bookstores about 10 years ago. 1999 is one year before Kent Beck released his seminal book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1257536953&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em></a><em> </em>which exposed the agile software process to the masses<strong>.</strong> Both Andrew Hunt and David Thomas originally signed the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>, together with Kent Beck himself and a few others, and it shows. But it would be dismissive to describe this as a book on agile since it’s much more.</p>
<p>The book is structured as a series short 46 sections. Each section has challenges and even exercises where appropriate. It touches on <strong>design</strong> concepts such as orthogonality, decoupling, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRY">DRY</a> (which it coined), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Languages">Domain Specific Languages</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Contract">Design By Contract</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring">Refactoring</a>; it has pages on <strong>process</strong> topics like build automation, “design to test”, test automation, estimation, requirements collection.</p>
<p>But where the book really shines is where it shows you how to “<em>become a better programmer</em>” (today we might say a <em>software</em> <em>craftsman</em>) and to take pride from it.</p>
<p>The <strong>pragmatic programmer</strong> is an early adopter, is inquisitive and realistic, and tries to be "f<em>amiliar with a broad range of technologies and environments</em>".</p>
<p>The pragmatic programmer takes responsibility, values quality but recognizes when the software is “<em>good enough</em>”. The pragmatic programmer is a continuous learner (the “<em>learn at least one new language every year</em>” advice is often quoted), thinks critically about what he reads and hear, and knows how to communicate. The books explains how you can build these qualities.</p>
<p>The sections that I enjoyed the most is when the authors discuss about <em>tools</em>: the pragmatic programmer prefers working with plain text (the book itself it’s been written from XML transformed into TeX), masters a shell (command line) which he/she can program, knows at least one text manipulation language (e.g. Perl) and how to generate code from metadata.</p>
<p>Even though the recent reprints have links to later tools like JUnit, Ant, etc… still a few parts of the book begin to show its age. For example the authors suggest to pick <em>one</em> text editor (e.g. Emacs or VI) and become a power user (not just know the keyboard shortcuts but also how to extend it to suit your needs). There used to be a time when you could spend your whole working day inside Emacs: you could edit and build your programs, open a shell, handle emails and browse newsgroups, edit text documents (with LaTeX for example), even play games. As much as I love Emacs, I believe today it’s virtually impossible to beat the productivity gains you can get with specialized IDEs like Visual Studio or Eclipse, with their intellisense and plug-in ecosystems.</p>
<p>All in all, the Pragmatic Programmer is easily one of the best book on software development I have ever read. It has really inspired me to continue my journey to become a <em>“better programmer”</em>. Thanks to this book, I have now in my action list: learn a scripting language (Ruby?); learn a functional language (F#?); learn how to use a shell in the Windows environment (PowerShell?); read a book on usability; read a book on the human side of software development (“Peopleware"?). A lot of things. A lot of fun ahead.</p>
