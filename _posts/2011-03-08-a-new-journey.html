<p>It was exactly 2 years ago.</p>
<p>I was embarking on the biggest change in my career as a software developer. Coming from about 10 years of development for Motorola, in an embedded environment, almost exclusively based on a closed proprietary OS, almost exclusively in a procedural language (C), I was moving to a modern VM-based environment (.NET),&nbsp; using an object oriented programming language (C#) always on the move (C# 3.0 had just been released), in a small sized company.&nbsp;I have learned a lot in these past two years in <a href="http://www.ors.it">ORS</a>, having the pleasure to work with a bunch of very talented developers, where I could practice <a href="http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/ch04.html#be_the_worst">being the worst</a> on several occasions.</p>
<p>Now, after two years, it's time for a new journey: I have recently joined&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deltatre.com">Deltatre</a>,&nbsp;a fast growing company in the sport IT business that is behind many big sport web sites (think <a href="http://www.uefa.com">uefa.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fifa.com">fifa.com</a>). I will be part of the core infrastructure team, reporting to the chief software architect, helping shaping the engine that delivers match events to a group of diverse client applications. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is this a very exciting professional opportunity, but luckily enough the office is located at a walking distance from my home (I have literally reduced my commuting time by more than one order of magnitude!). This will leave me more time for my family, and I especially look forward to spending more time with my two kids.</p>
