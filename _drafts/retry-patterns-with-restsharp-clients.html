<p>In this post we will explore how to make <a href="http://restsharp.org/">RestSharp </a>more robust and go from using it like this:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">var response = restclient.Execute(request);
</pre>
<p>to something like this (and more complex variations) using <a href="https://github.com/michael-wolfenden/Polly">Polly</a>:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">var response =
Policy
.Handle&lt;TimeoutException&gt;()
.Retry()
.Execute(() =&gt; restclient.Execute(request));
</pre>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Developing applications for the cloud, especially when consuming other (micro)services via HTTP endpoints, exposes the developer to the risks of <strong>transient failures,</strong> which can be caused by network hiccups, servers being overloaded, requests being throttled, etc...</p>
<p>In order to try and overcome these failures, we should code our clientsÂ in such a way that, whenever appropriate, a request is attempted again up to a certain number of times (possibly implementing some form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a>).</p>
<p>Writing such kind of code is not particularly complicated, but this is a solved problem and therefore you probably should not reinvent the wheel.</p>
<h3>Along Came Polly</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/michael-wolfenden/Polly">Polly</a> is one of the many libraries in the .NET ecosystem dealing with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/dn589788.aspx">retry pattern</a> (including <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/dn589784.aspx">circuit breaker</a> support).</p>
<p>The example at the top shows that with just a few lines of code we can ask Polly to issue a REST request and to retry once if a timeout exception is raised. Of course, you usually may want to try something a bit more sophisticated:</p>
